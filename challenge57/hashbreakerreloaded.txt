Like the previous hashbreaker challenge, I assumed that it is an SHA1 hash and that the original message is
actually a number with 4 digits (between 1000-9999 inclusively).
Therefore, it is easy to brute-force (worst-case scenario = 9000 tries),
we just have to figure out how the salt is used in the hash

Use any language, I used Python, just make sure you have the necessary libraries to :
 - Fetch the HTML content of a webpage using your PHPSESSID cookie (because you need to be logged in to access it)
 - Extract the hash from the webpage
 - Brute force each possibility to compare it to the hash (sha1-hash each number between 1000-9999)
    - Try different possibilities of salt concatenation for every number (ex: number+salt, salt+number, etc.)
    - Answer will be the number itself, break the loop to continue
 - Fetch the webpage using the answer in the URL ("... challenges/57/result_value"), still using PHPSESSID cookie
 - Extract the flag (RegEx very useful again), but at this point you can manually extract it from the HTML if you print it
