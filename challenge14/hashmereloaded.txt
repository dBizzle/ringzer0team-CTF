Use any language, I used Python, just make sure you have the necessary libraries to : 
 - Fetch the HTML content of a webpage using your PHPSESSID (because you need to be logged in to access it)
 - Extract the message (Regular Expressions are very useful for this)
 - Convert the binary string to ASCII string
 - hash the message (ASCII) with SHA512 hexdigest
 - Fetch the webpage using the hashed message in the URL ("... challenges/14/your_hash") still using PHPSESSID
 - Extract the flag (RegEx very useful again), but at this point you can manually extract it from the HTML
